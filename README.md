This has kind of been decided already for everyone's ease of operations:
-we will be deploying both our server and mongoDB on the same droplet in DigitalOcean for compatibility and ease of connection.
   -I can host this on my own account if people dont have the credits/money to cover it, No problem. 

Things Josh is working on currently: 
-server.js
   -implement Schemas for users, and possibly "projects?"
   -update routes
   - Sanitize and validate inputs
   - Check routes for authentication
   - Add a logout route
   - Implement HTTPS
   - (if possible/time allows) Implement a logging system 
    for security monitoring.
-other .js scripts for page functionalities.
   - I need 99% finished HTML pages to produce their script.js for functionality.
     I dont want to rewrite these over and over for small html changes.
   - This is why im focusing on the loginScript.js and homeScript.js files first.  
-adjusting our license.
-prepping the droplet with necessary installs of node-modules and any extra libraries/modules we may decide to use.
