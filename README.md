This has been decided for everyone's ease of operations:
We will be deploying both our server and mongoDB on the same droplet in DigitalOcean for compatibility and ease of connection.
   -I(josh) am hosting this currently. I have created some of our directories, installed 99% of our npm modules (will recheck this), and updated the system itself.
   I do not intend to post the address on here just in case but it is accessible through ssh if anyone needs to get in there. DM me for login info and please 
   let me know what you're doing. 

-server.js
   - Sanitize and validate inputs?

-Implement HTTPS?  
-(if possible/time allows) Implement a logging system for security monitoring?     
-adjusting our license?
